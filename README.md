## About

**Smash Embedded** is a personal collection of open-source embedded systems projects for the embedded and robotics community —  focused on building meaningful tools for microcontrollers, robotics, and DIY electronics. Projects here are open-source, hardware-oriented, and built to push the limits of what small systems can do.

These are hands-on projects developed for those who enjoy pushing hardware to do more with less.  
The aim: to share compact, well-crafted solutions that others can learn from, build on, or simply enjoy exploring.


### Aresas of focus:

- **Arduino** & **ESP32** + **FreeRTOS** real-time applications.
- **Verilog** projects on **Icezum Alhambra** FPGA
- **Zenoh** & **Zenoh-pico** for distributed comms, low-latency communication, robotics and sensor systems.
- Robot integration with **ROS 2**
- Real-time dashboards, async web UIs, and hardware visualizations

Each project is created with clarity and reproducibility in mind, aiming to be as useful as it is fun to build.

More advanced tools and systems are in development — stay tuned.
