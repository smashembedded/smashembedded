## About

**Smash Embedded** is focused on building high-performance, low-level tools for the embedded and robotics community.  
Projects here are open-source, hardware-oriented, and built to push the limits of what small systems can do.

Core focus areas:

- ESP32 + FreeRTOS microcontroller applications
- Zenoh-pico for distributed, low-latency communication
- Robot integration with ROS 2
- Verilog projects on Icezum Alhambra FPGA
- Real-time dashboards, async web UIs, and hardware visualizations

More advanced tools and systems are in development — stay tuned.
